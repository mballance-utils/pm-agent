# Weekly Update

Determine the current date and prepare a weekly update report for this
date. Check the working directory for projects to query. Use the 'gh'
tool to get activity within each project for the current week leading
up to the current date.
- Issues opened and resolved
- Pull requests merged

Prepare a short informal update on the project direction based on 
issues and PRs.

Create a status report highlighting:
- New opportunities
- Areas of concern

If a yearly (strategy/<tool>-ProductStrategy-<year>.md), quarterly
(strategy/<tool>-ProductStrategy-<year>Q<x>.md) exists, use these 
in assessing new opportunities and areas of concern


Save the report to weekly_report.md
